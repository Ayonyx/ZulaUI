==Zula UI==

This is my Age of Conan GUI, it's very limited in options because
it's purely what I use and I don't plan on changing it. I may make
some slight adjustments to it here and there but basically the
layout will remain the same. 

Features:
 
 - 52 Action Buttons
 - Square Minimap
 - ClearFont text mod

Information:
 
 - Designed to work on 1680x1050
 - Uses all in game art, except the minimap (which is similar)
 - All directional attack keys are hidden as I don't really need to 
   see them.

Credits:
 
 - Thanks to BelaUI which is the basis of the mod
