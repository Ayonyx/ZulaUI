h2. Zula UI 

This is my Age of Conan GUI, it's very limited in options because
it's purely what I use and I don't plan on changing it. I may make
some slight adjustments to it here and there but basically the
layout will remain the same.

h3. Information

* Square Minimap
* ClearFont text mod
* 1680 x 1050 design
* Basically all in-game Art
** Minimap is Custom
** CSI is custom
* Directional attack keys are hidden
